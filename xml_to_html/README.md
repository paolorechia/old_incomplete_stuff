# xml_to_html
doc book xml to html script

This python script receives at command line 1 argument (an doc book .xml file generated by LibreOffice) and convert
the xml tags into html tags.
It then saves the output to a different file (.txt)

Incomplete. 
To be done: 
1 - add ALL doc book tags to the dictionary; 
2 - polish the output format; 
3 - properly parse the first three lines (the script is skipping them)
