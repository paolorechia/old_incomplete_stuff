#This is a simple turtle graphics system, built as a programming exercise from "The Pragmatic Programmer" book.

Basically the user should provide an input file where each line contains a Capital letter (P, D, W, N, E, S, U) and an amount of movement in pixels. Specifically:
P - not implemented
U - pen up (does NOT draw)
D - pen down (draws)
N - north
W - west
N - east
S - south

In order to see the results, open the .html and upload the input file.
